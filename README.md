## 👋 About Me

I’m a PhD student and graduate research assistant at the **SOCAL Research Group** (UC Riverside), working under Professor Daniel Wong. My research sits at the intersection of **Systems Optimization** and **Computer Architecture**—especially using **eBPF**, **Linux kernel tracing**, and advanced observability techniques to drive better system performance and efficient runtime management.

My current focus is on leveraging eBPF for application-level metric collection, powering smarter dynamic power management and **QoS-aware energy optimization in heterogeneous systems**.

## 📖 Fun Fact

When I’m not hacking on kernel modules or reading about computer systems, you’ll find me curled up with a good book.
